# Type Casting = convert the data type of a value to another data type

x = 1 # Int
y = 2.0 # Float
z = "3" # str

# int(y) would turn var y into an integer data type.



print(x)
print(y) # print(int(y)) ---- This would temporarily cast this to an int data type
print(z)

y = int(y) # This would Permanently cast this to an int data type
z = int(z) # Type casts z into int allowing us to perform calculations on it
print(z*3) # Example of performing a calculation after type casting
