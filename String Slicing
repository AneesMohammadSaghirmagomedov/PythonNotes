# slicing = create a substring by extracting characters from another string
#           indexing[] or slice()
#           [start:stop:step] ~side note: the "stop" index is exclusive meaning not including
#           starts ON character and end BEFORE character
name = "Anees Saghir"

first_name = name[:5] # This will give the first name as the final character is actually 4
#                       "0:" is not included at start as it is default

funky_name = name[0:12:1] # This will display my Normal Name.
funky_name = name[0:12:2] # This will display every 2nd character including first.
#                 ^ ^ If These two indexes are left blank then the program assumes
#                     to be the start and the end of the string.

reversed_name = name[::-1] # This "counts back" essentially REVERSES our string

#Slice()  ~ (start, stop, step)

website = "http://google.com" # we want only the web name "google" in this url

slice = slice(7,-4)  # the negative stop is used counting back from ".com" to go
#                      till whatever lies before that

print(website[slice]) # applies the slice
