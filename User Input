# User Input

age = input("how old are you?: ")  # Assigns the input to a variable
age += 1 # This line would result in an error as we can't do calculations as all inputs are strings
         
# HOW TO FIX THIS :-
    age = int(input("what is your age?: ")) # We cast the input as int so we can use it for calculations

print("you are "+str(age)+" years old") # Notice how we cast age back to str?
